# Project Status

## Current phase

Prototype review

## Current mode

Build

## Current objective

Confirm the refined hybrid A interaction model and use the recorded decision to
shape the production workspace ticket.

## Approved specification

`docs/specification.md`, approved July 23, 2026.

## Active ticket

GitHub issue #20: Prototype V1 project workspace UI variants.

## Completed

- Repository AI workflow configured.
- CMMC and HIPAA V1 discovery completed.
- Draft specification, roadmap, operating model, and prototype brief created.
- Specification, roadmap, and prototype brief approved.
- Legacy application and obsolete backlog moved under `legacy/`.
- Tech-debt and bloat review gates added to delivery workflow.
- Three read-only V1 project workspace UI variants built and visually verified
  for GitHub issue #20.
- Initial interaction direction selected: Variant A shell and assessment
  workspace with Variant B's compact phase rail and work-resumption context on
  the Overview.
- Overview refined to project-level orientation only; requirement review and
  contextual guidance now live in a dedicated objective-by-objective
  Assessments workspace.
- Unified actionable work now follows the Overview directly, with redundant
  evidence/risk/report summaries removed and compact notification/user context
  added above the project identity.
- Overview remains chart-free and uses the available space for a fuller unified
  queue; Assessments now centers decision guidance and places implementation,
  evidence, and notes in the right-side working record.
- Selected Variant A was collapsed into a single prototype workspace. Dashboard
  now sits above client profiles and owns the cross-client Unified Queue, while
  each selected client Overview owns its Client Queue; variants B/C and the
  switcher were removed.
- Project end date is now modeled as an onboarding/profile field and surfaced
  in client selection, project identity, and global portfolio orientation.
- Dashboard now places Active Projects above Unified Queue with end dates and
  days remaining; client metric strips emphasize the project end schedule in
  place of redundant due-soon counts.
- Active Projects now uses a stacked list and shows a separate project
  completion percentage and progress bar for each engagement.
- Client Profile now prototypes the progressive profile model: the onboarding
  baseline remains visible beside the enriched implementation state and target,
  with scope counts, schedule, unresolved inputs, assessment impact, and
  downstream consumers shown for synthetic CMMC and HIPAA engagements.

- Actions / POA&M prototyped as a record surface distinct from the two queues,
  with distinct record types, framework-specific vocabulary, an explicit
  Ready for Validation group, and per-record close conditions.
- Agent workflow hardened: CLAUDE.md pointer, CI running prototype typecheck and
  build on every push, UI review rules recorded in AGENTS.md, tech-debt gate text
  deduplicated, test-depth tiers defined, and ADR 0011 added for generated output
  language.
- Prototyping stopped. Coverage matches the next three slices; Evidence, Risks,
  Policies, and Reports are deferred to their own slices rather than prototyped
  months before implementation.
- Specification updated with the accepted interaction model, the
  objective-to-requirement rollup rule, and work-item state transitions.

## In progress

- Specification revision awaiting Johnathan's approval before production BUILD.

## Blocked

- Production ticket for Slice 1 is blocked on two decisions: confirmation of the
  rollup rule against controlling CMMC assessment guidance, and the
  first-real-engagement threshold.

## Known risks

- The final HIPAA catalog source and document templates are still open inputs.
- The local `data/` folder contains legacy evidence and exports that must be
  preserved until a separate backup/retention decision is made.

## Next recommended action

Review and approve the specification revision, and decide the two blocked items.
Then the Slice 1 production ticket is written against the approved specification
and reimplemented from clean `main` without promoting prototype code.
